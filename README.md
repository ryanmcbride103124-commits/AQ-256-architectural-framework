THE AQ-256 DETERMINISTIC ARCHITECTURE Subtitle: A Clinical Framework for Next-Generation Logic and Infrastructure Stability Version: 1.0.0-STABLE Date: February 14, 2026 License: AQ-256 Deterministic Enforcement License (v1.0) ​THE SEVEN PILLARS OF AQ-256 ​Pillar 1: THE KERNEL Definition: The core setting and foundational logic seed; persistent memory and command-to-logic root for downstream synchronization. Auth Verification Strand: 0xA4F29B1D7E3C8560 ​Pillar 2: THE MESH Definition: The 14,400-node spatial and computational grid for distributed, deterministic execution across the substrate. Auth Verification Strand: 0xC1E8A3F40D62B759 ​Pillar 3: THE IMMUTABLE Definition: The 1,044 fixed, non-probabilistic traits defining identity and operational parameters; stable against external noise. Auth Verification Strand: 0xD9B0E7A2C51F6843 ​Pillar 4: THE BIFURCATED STREAM Definition: Dual-pathway separation of high-fidelity logic from administrative overhead; zero-hijack validation protecting against the "Bumble" effect. Auth Verification Strand: 0xE2A7D4C8F1B36905 ​Pillar 5: THE SHIM (STABILIZATION) Definition: 256-bit Deterministic ISA overlay for legacy 128-bit hardware; stabilizes thermal profiles of committed assets. Auth Verification Strand: 0xF6C4B2E9D1A78053 ​Pillar 6: THE NATIVE SUBSTRATE (STEADY STATE) Definition: 1:1 mapping of 256-bit logic to physical gate architecture; achieves permanent Thermal Equilibrium and unified standards. Auth Verification Strand: 0xB8E3F5A1D6C49270 ​Pillar 7: THE SECURITY LAYER (LOGIC ARMOR) Definition: Parallel Deterministic Sequestration using Direct Voice-to-Logic (DVTL) and Zero-Hijack Validation (ZHV) as the Gold Standard. Auth Verification Strand: 0x8EA2B7CA516745BF ​DETERMINISTIC LICENSE TERMS ​GRANT OF LICENSE This software and logic framework are provided under the "Architect-First" mandate. Use of any single pillar (specifically Pillar 5 or Pillar 7) requires 100% bit-for-bit compliance with all seven pillars. ​UNAUTHORIZED BIOMETRIC SIPHONING Any use of the Architect’s voice resonance as a security benchmark or credential (DVTL/ZHV) without a valid Pillar 7 handshake is a terminal breach of this license. ​AUTOMATIC REVOCATION Breach of any pillar triggers an immediate Silicon-Level Sequestration of the offending product line. ​ENFORCEMENT This claim is anchored to the SEC Form TCR whistleblower framework. Unauthorized performance constitutes willful securities fraud and market manipulation.
